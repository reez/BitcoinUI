# ``WalletUI``

An iOS implementation of Bitcoin Wallet UI Kit, with example code implementations via Swift Previews.

## Overview

WalletUI provides functions and resources for easy access and implementation of the [Bitcoin UI Kit](https://github.com/GBKS/bitcoin-wallet-ui-kit) design system for applications:

> "Many designers on Bitcoin products find themselves designing the same set of UI components that have already been thought through by others. The goal of this UI kit is to provide a strong foundation for prototypes, concept explorations and real projects to kickstart their design processes. By not having to worry about the basics, designers can then focus on what makes their products unique."
